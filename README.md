# Hangman-Game
A simple Hang-Man game written in Python using the basic syntax.
The main module 'Hang-Man Game.py' host the games functionality.
The two other modules, 'hangman_art.py & hangman_words.py' act as hosts of art displays and a list of words respectively.

The game begins with the user having to guess a word before there lives run out. When the lives run out the user loses the game.

The game begins the user with 6 lives. If a user answers a letter correctly, it will get written into the empty blankspace and fill in where the letter should be.
If the user guesses incorrectly, the user will lose a life and a piece of a stick figure will be outputted as a result.

The end goal is to have the user guess the correct word before the stick figure is drawn completely.
